- 👋 Hi, I’m Łukasz - @TaktyKK1
- I'm a student of Computer Science with a specialization in Programming Business Applications at the Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, Poland. 
During my studies I got to know SQL, C#, ASP.NET, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C/C++(embedded systems).
- 👀 I like to read, mostly science-fiction or fantasy, but other than that I also like to solve sudoku-type logic games, play multiplayer computer games or chess.
